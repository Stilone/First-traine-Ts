This project, represents my initial exploration into using TypeScript (TS) for development. It serves as a testament to my early experiences and learning journey with this powerful statically-typed superset of JavaScript.

Initially, TypeScript seemed daunting and complex, and I doubted whether I could ever grasp its intricacies. However, as time passed, I discovered that understanding this technology simply required dedicating more time to learning and engaging in practical application.
